# double-life
It is a little project I started to learn java but it eventually evolved into a game
I started making a pokemon game but due to feature creep I renamed it into double-life.
Java part will essentially act as a game server and talks to any external gui
The server will be a text version of the game. You can play it right here in your terminal if you wanted to

By the end of this project I am trying to do the following:
- [] make a game with a nice game loop
- [] make it multiplayer
- [] make it cross platform
